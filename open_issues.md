## Lauren's comments

- Have a mode with a timer and/or three strikes, you're out (with a strike being
re-flipping over a card you've already flipped but not matching it)
- Make the screen timeout last longer
- Formatting to the center of the screen
- Maybe have cards drop off the page when you pair them
- Let people set "themes" for their picture cards (Mario, Legos, Batman, unicorns)
- Everything about the timing is great
